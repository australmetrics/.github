# 🌿 AustralMetrics

**Applied AI systems for agriculture.**  
We design and deploy locally-executable, multimodal pipelines for data-driven decision-making in rural agricultural environments.

## 🚜 What we build

- **Field-ready ML systems**: Integrating satellite imagery, multispectral drone video, sensor data, and agronomic documents.
- **Offline-first architecture**: All models and pipelines are designed to operate on-premise in low-connectivity regions.
- **Multimodal & geospatial AI**: Combining computer vision, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reinforcement learning to support crop decisions and optimize supply chains.

## 🧠 Core technologies

`PyTorch` · `TorchAO` · `ExecuTorch` · `GDAL` · `rasterio` · `scikit-learn` · `MLflow` · `GeoPandas` · `FAISS` · `LangChain`

## 📍 Context of deployment

All our work is validated under real agricultural conditions in southern Chile (Ñuble, Biobío, La Araucanía, Los Lagos), supporting crops like cherries, maize, and potatoes.

## 🤝 Contributions

Some components of our geospatial and ingestion stack are open-source to support the agri-tech and applied AI communities.

> We bring frontier AI where it’s needed most: offline, explainable, and field-resilient.
